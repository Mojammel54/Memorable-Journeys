                    <p>SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. SQL databases are table-based, while NoSQL databases are document, key-value, graph, or wide-column stores. SQL databases are better for multi-row transactions, while NoSQL is better for unstructured data like documents or JSON.</p>

                    <p>JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.It is compact, readable and digitally signed using a private key/ or a public key pair by the Identity Provider(IdP). So the integrity and authenticity of the token can be verified by other parties involved.The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data. JWT is signed and encoded, not encrypted.JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesn't have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information.Basically the identity provider(IdP) generates a JWT certifying user identity and Resource server decodes and verifies the authenticity of the token using secret salt / public key.</p>

                    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, object-oriented scripting language that is used to build dynamic HTML pages with interactive effects on a webpage. On the other hand, Node.js usually represents a list of objects and methods accessible to JavaScript code when run in the V8 engine or via the node interpreter.Javascript is a programming language that is used for writing scripts on the website. NodeJS is a Javascript runtime environment</p>

                    <p> Node JS Platform uses “Single Threaded Event Loop” architecture to handle multiple concurrent clients.It receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them.</p>
